# Integration Plan: Learning Engine into Prediction Engine

## Steps to Complete

- [ ] Import learning_engine module in prediction_engine.py
- [ ] Modify ensemble_predict() to use ML model for scoring predictions
- [ ] Adjust final predictions based on ML confidence scores
- [ ] Ensure fallback to original ensemble if ML model not available
- [ ] Test the integration by running predictions
