# Integration Plan: Learning Engine into Prediction Engine

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Import learning_engine module in prediction_engine.py
- [x] Modify ensemble_predict() to use ML model for scoring predictions
- [x] Adjust final predictions based on ML confidence scores
- [x] Ensure fallback to original ensemble if ML model not available
- [ ] Test the integration by running predictions
