CRITICAL: WHICH APP.PY IS RUNNING?
================================================================================

Please do this:

1. STOP Flask (press Ctrl+C in the terminal)

2. Look at the terminal output BEFORE you stopped it
   - It should say something like:
     "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
   - Check if it says which file is running

3. Check your terminal - what command did you use to start Flask?
   - Did you run: python app.py
   - Or: python app_final.py
   - Or: python main.py
   - Or: flask run

4. START Flask again with VERBOSE output:
   python app.py

5. Copy and paste the FIRST 20 LINES of output here

6. While Flask is running, open a NEW terminal and run:
   python FINAL_TEST.py

7. Then in your browser, press F12 (open DevTools)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   - Look at the request to "/"
   - Check the Response tab
   - Search for "2025" in the HTML
   - Take a screenshot

================================================================================
POSSIBLE ISSUES:
================================================================================

1. You're running a DIFFERENT app.py file (app_final.py, main.py, etc.)
2. You have MULTIPLE Flask instances running
3. Browser is showing cached data
4. You're looking at a different port (5001, 8000, etc.)
